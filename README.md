# cpp-actions-learning
Me finally sitting down and learning how to use GitHubs actions to do some stuff.

This project compiles the example `main.cpp` for multiple OS's and with the correct tag Creates a release with the artifacts. Uses Ccache to speed up compilation.

Insiration and some code for building was gotten from [here](https://cristianadam.eu/20191222/using-github-actions-with-c-plus-plus-and-cmake/).
